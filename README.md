TBOT aim to build a next-gen KOL virtual sandbox. It's a twitch chat bot that helps you get more effective interaction with audiences, including multi-dimensional analytics, real-time analytics, etc.

TBOT is only one entry point to construct the virtual sandbox system. Now we are trying virtual avatars, paintint, music, games and other different fields.

# Upstream
[Firebot](https://github.com/crowbartools/Firebot) is the upstream of TBOT. We are very grateful to Firebot community for contributing such an excellent twitch bot.

TBOT was developed based on version 5.39.2 of Firebot released in early 2021. We adopted the framework, at the same time, we added real-time analytics , and other important features, also we deleted some features, hoping they will be the simplest for use.

We will continue to contribute to Firebot and help to build the open source KOL virtual sandbox in the future.
